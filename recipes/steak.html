  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>4 hard rolls, split</li>
      <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>3 gloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 pounds round steak, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 large onion, sliced and quartered</li>
      <li>1 pinch coarse sea salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon liquid smoke</li>
      <li>8 (1 ounce) slices provolone cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Split 
      the rolls open and toast them on a baking sheet in the oven 
      while it is preheating. Mix together the mayonnaise, garlic, 
      and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl. Refrigerate until 
      ready to use. Remove the rolls from the oven when toasted 
      as desired.</li>
      <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
      Carefully place the sliced steak and onions in the pan and 
      season with sea salt, Worcestershire sauce, and liquid 
      smoke. Cook and stir until the steak is browned and the 
      onion is tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Generously spread the prepared garlic-Parmesan 
      mayonnaise on both halves of the toasted rolls. Divide the 
      steak and onion mixture evenly among the bottom halves of 
      the rolls, piling them high. Top each with 2 slices 
      provolone cheese and sprinkle with Italian seasoning. Place 
      the tops on the sandwiches.</li>
      <li>Bake the sandwiches on a baking sheet in the preheated 
      oven until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
